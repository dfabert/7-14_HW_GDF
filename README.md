Homework Due 7/14

I had some trouble with my initial upload and somehow ended up downloading the old file.  However, the second time was much smoother.  

With the HTML, most of the clean up was just organization.  Naming the footer "footer" and making sections instead of divs.  I made two sections, one for each side of the page.  

With the header, I found that there were too many rules in CSS for the list, so I made that just one (header div ul li).  I was thinking that I might be able to get the header rules down to just "header" but it seems like the list has to have its own set of rules.  I might need some more explaination on that.  Furthermore, I thought by putting all of the "a" rules in the "div ul li" rules, it would just filter down, but it did not.  

The links in the header were broken but now work.  I made each of them go to the respective id in the "content" section.  However, these IDs don't have any rules in the CSS side of things, since all of the rules are set with the "content" class.  I was able to get the content down to four rules sections (section + img, div & h2).

I renamed the css rules for the right side "sidebar" since I think that explains the loction a bit better.  The same as above, I wasn't able to get it to less than 4 rules sections.  

The footer recieved the tag "footer".  I was able to get it down to two sets of rules (footer and h2).

While editing the HTML, I created spaces between the sections to clearly see them and then closed them back up afterwards.
